Image 1: Distribution of Cobalt Transport Cost
This graph shows how much it might cost to transport cobalt. 
The middle bump (around $8,000) is the most likely cost. 
Sometimes it could be cheaper (around $5,000) or more expensive (up to $12,000), but that's less common.

Image 2: Distribution of Cobalt Transport Emissions
This shows three different ways to measure pollution from transporting cobalt:
-Red area: First method says about 70 kg of pollution
-Blue area: Second method says about 85 kg of pollution
-Green area: Third method says about 130 kg of pollution
Different methods give different answers.

Image 3: Correlation Matrix
This is a heat map showing which factors affect each other. Blue squares with numbers close to 1.0 mean those two things are strongly connected. The important observations:
-Sea distance strongly affects IPCC and GREET emissions (0.74 and 0.66)
-Land distance strongly affects ecoinvent emissions (0.57)
-Battery weight and cathode percentage strongly affect cost (0.64 and 0.65)

Image 4: Variable Impact
This shows what factors matter most for each outcome:
-Red bars: What affects cost most (cathode percentage and battery weight)
-Blue bars: What affects ecoinvent emissions most (land distance)
-Green bars: What affects GREET emissions most (sea distance)
-Purple bars: What affects IPCC emissions most (sea distance)
Longer bars mean stronger influence.

Image 5: Top Factors Affecting Cost
Each panel shows how one factor affects cost:
-Left: As battery weight increases, cost increases
-Middle: As cathode percentage increases, cost increases
-Right: As South Korea's costs increase, overall cost increases

Image 6: Top Factors Affecting Emissions
Similar to Image 5, but for emissions:
-Left: As battery weight increases, emissions increase
-Middle: As cathode percentage increases, emissions increase
-Right: As land distance increases, emissions increase

The main takeaway is: Battery design factors (weight and cathode percentage) mostly affect cost, while transport distances (sea and land) mostly affect emissions.
